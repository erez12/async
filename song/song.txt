Construct A Song:
1. A song in our system is represented as an JSON array of verse where each vers has a url to get that vers and
    part to know what is its location in the full song.
    [{
        url: '/path_to_part1',
        part: 1
    },{
        url: '/path_to_part3',
        part: 3
    },{
        url: '/path_to_part2',
        part: 2
    }...]
2. Create a function getSong which gets a url to song JSON and callback. The function will call the callback with the joined
    result of making requests to each vers.
3. assume we have the following request method
    function request(url, callback) {...}
    This function will make a GET request and return response in the callback (assume all requests are successful :) )

For example for the json in 1 we want to get
    "${request('/path_to_part1')} ${request('/path_to_part2')} ${request('/path_to_part3')}"
